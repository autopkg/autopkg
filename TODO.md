Todo:
-----

* Remove 'autopkg' and 'automunkiimport' tools; replace them with the tool currently named 'auto' (which will probably be renamed to 'autopkg')



These were migrated over from a TODO list from around April/May 2013.

* Convert these to GH issues:
  * Logging and progress display.
  * Receipts should include all output messages.
  * Implement pkg options.
  * Add --scripts to packager.py.
  * Create an installer package for AutoPkg.
  * Chown when creating package roots shouldn't always be recursive.
