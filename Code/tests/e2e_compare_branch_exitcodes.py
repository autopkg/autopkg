e2e_compare_branch_exitcodes.py

This script is intended to test a new feature or bugfix branch of AutoPkg against a known stable
branch (e.g. main/master).

A specified number of recipes are selected at random from a provided path. Each recipe is run twice
(once without cache, once with) on the control branch, then run twice again on the experimental
branch. If the exit codes produced by the control branch differ from the exit codes produced by the
experimental branch for the same recipe, the discrepancy is reported.
